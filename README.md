**Enjoy a cool matrix/hacker effect on PC startup**

---

### HOW TO PREVIEW THE EFFECTS:

You can preview the `Matrix Effect 1.1` & `1.2` just by double click, for the Hacker Effects you'll have to:

- Install the Cascadia Code font *(if not already)*  

- Create a shortcut for `Hacker Effect 1.1` & `1.2` 

- Right click shortcut > Properties > Font 

- Select the Cascadia Code font > Apply 

- Select the Layout tab 

- Under the Window Size width & height change the height to 90 > Apply > OK

Now you can preview the hacker effects and move on to next step

---

## HOW TO SET IT FOR STARTUP

- Choose whichever you prefer, 
  - if you want a Hacker Effect copy the shortcut 
  - if you want a Matrix Effect create a shortcut for it then right click it > cut

- Press `Win + R` and type `shell:startup`  

- Paste the shortcut for the effect into that startup folder

That’s all! The matrix/hacker effect  will now appear whenever you start up your PC.  

---

### NOTES:  

- Some of the effects may run slower depending on your computer

- For the Hacker Effects, if you move the files later then the shortcut in shell:startup folder will break 

- You can easily change the number of tabs for Matrix Effect 1.2.bat   
  Edit the .bat in notepad and change this number to whatever you prefer

```bat
    :: Number of tabs to open
    set "count=7"
```
