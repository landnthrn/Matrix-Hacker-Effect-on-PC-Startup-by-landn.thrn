# MATRIX & HACKER EFFECT ON STARTUP

**Enjoy a cool matrix/hacker effect on PC startup**

---

## HOW TO SETUP:

- Go to `C:\Windows` in your File Explorer or press `Win + R` and type `%windir%`

- In this folder, create a new folder and title it `Scripts`  

- Inside the `Scripts` folder created another called `MatrixEffect` 

- Drag all the files from this download into the folder

---

### HOW TO PREVIEW THE EFFECTS:

You can preview the `Matrix Effect 1.1` & `1.2` just by double click, for the Hacker Effects you'll have to:

- Install the Cascadia Code font  

- Create a shortcut for `Hacker Effect 1.1` & `1.2` 

- Right click shortcut > Properties > Font 

- Select the Cascadia Code font > Apply 

- Select the Layout tab 

- Under the Window Size width & height change the height to 90 > Apply > OK

- Now you can preview the hacker effects and move on to next step

---

## HOW TO SET IT FOR STARTUP

- Choose whichever you prefer, 
  - if you want a Hacker Effect copy the shortcut 
  - if you want a Matrix Effect create a shortcut for it then right click it > cut

- Press `Win + R` and type `shell:startup`  

- Paste the shortcut for the effect into that startup folder

That’s all! The matrix/hacker effect  will now appear whenever you start up your PC.  

---

### NOTES:  

- Don't rename the files or place them in other folders than `C:\Windows\Scripts\MatrixEffect` 
  unless you know how to change the paths in the files & shortcuts

- If you want to customize the effects yourself it's rather simple

- The Matrix Effect 1.2 option might run slowly depending on your computer.

  - You can easily change the number of tabs — just right-click on the Matrix 7 Tabs.bat file and press Edit,  
    then change the number to whatever you prefer on this chunk

```bat
    :: Number of tabs to open
    set "count=7"
```
